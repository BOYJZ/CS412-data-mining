1.(a) A five-number summary of a distribution contains minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum, where Q1 is 25th percentile, Q3 is 75th percentile. It gives a rough description of the distribution of data.

(b) Data represented with a box is called box plot. It is used in explanatory data analysis and could visually show the distribution of numerical data and skewness.

Box plot is graphic display of five-number summary. 

​	(i)Q1, Q3, IQR: Box starts at Q1(25th percentile) and ends at Q3(75th percentile). The height of box is IQR=Q3-Q1. 

​	(ii)Median is marked by a line within the box.

​	(iii)Two lines outside the box extended to  Minimum and Maximum.

​	(iv)Outliers: points beyond a specified outlier threshold, plotted individually, usually higher||lower than 1.5IQR

(c)Yes, they can.

Reason: Box plot gives a rough description of data distribution, which only contains five-number summary. If two different datasets have the same five-number summary, then the box plot of them are the same.

Example: A={-2,-2,-1,0,0,1,2,2} B={-2,-1.5,-1,0,0,1,2,2} For A and B, min=-2, Q1=-1, median=0, Q3=2, max=2. Therefore, the box plot of A and B are the same. However, A and B are different. Therefore, two different distributions can have the exact same box plot.

(d)(i)Yes, it can.

Reason: Q-Q plot graphs the quantiles of one univariate distribution against the corresponding  quantiles of another. If the price of A is always larger than the price of B at the same percentile, then the line is below y=x.

Example: A follows the distribution of $p_a=(a+1)^{per}-1$, where per is the percentile variable, ranging from 0 to 1. B follows the distribution of $p_b=log_{a+1}(per+1)$.  The Q-Q plot in this case stays entirely below the y = x line except for the endpoints (0,0) and (a,a).

(ii)No, I disagree.

Reason: If $(m_a,m_b)$ lives above the y=x line, then $m_a<m_b$. Median and mean are different: median is the value of the middle distribution, which is highly connected with percentile; mean of x is $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{i=n}x_i$. If the data of lower or higher percentile of A is mainly around higher of B, then the hypothesis is wrong.

Example: A={$\frac{a}{4}$,$\frac{a}{4}$,$\frac{a}{4}$,a,a} B={0,0,$\frac{a}{2}$,a,a}, where $\mu_B=\frac{a}{2}=\frac{10a}{20}<\frac{11a}{20}=\mu_A$ and $m_B=\frac{a}{2}>\frac{a}{4}=m_A$. ($m_A,m_B$) lives above the y=x line but $\mu_B<\mu_A$, which disobeys the hypothesis.

$$
Lift(A,B)=\frac{s(A\cup B)}{s(A)\times s(B)}=\frac{200/20800}{400/20800\times600/20800}\approx 17.333
$$

$$
Jaccard(A,B)=\frac{s(A\cup B)}{s(A)+s(B)-s(A \cup B)}=\frac{200/20800}{200/20800+200/20800+400/20800}=0.25
$$

$$
Cosine(A,B)=\frac{s(A\cup B)}{\sqrt(s(A) \times s(B))}=\frac{200/20800}{\sqrt400/20800\times600/20800}\approx0.408
$$

$$
Kulczynski(A,B)=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{s(A\cup B)}{s(A)}+\frac{s(A\cup B)}{s(B)})=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{200/20800}{400/20800}+\frac{200/20800}{600/20800})\approx 0.417
$$

(b)Yes, I agree.

Suppose A,B obey the following rules.

|       | B    | B'   | total   |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| A     | a    | b    | a+b     |
| A'    | c    | d    | c+d     |
| TOTAL | a+c  | b+d  | a+b+c+d |

$$
P(B|A)=\frac{s(A \cup B)}{s(A)}=\frac{a/(a+b+c+d)}{(a+b)/(a+b+c+d)}=\frac{a}{a+b}
$$

$$
P(A|B)=\frac{s(A \cup B)}{s(B)}=\frac{a/(a+b+c+d)}{(a+c)/(a+b+c+d)}=\frac{a}{a+c}
$$

Both P(B|A) and P(A|B) don't contain any "d" . Therefore, they are null-invariant. 

Inputs of the function $I(A,B)=f(P(B|A),P(A|B))$ are $\frac{a}{a+b}$ and $\frac{a}{a+c}$, which don't contain any "d". 

Since the total number (a+b+c+d) is also unknown, d could not be created by minus: (a+b+c+d)-a-b-c. 

Therefore, d should never appears in $I(A,B)$. Therefore, $I$ is null-invariant.

(b)(i) Constrain 1: average(price)>50 is Convertible. 

Reason: After proper ordering the prices of all items, data can either be monotone or anti-monotone. For example, if the prices of items are ascending order(price increases as number of items increases), then it is anti-monotone. If a set violates constrain, then all supersets violates.

Mine measures: 1. sort data 2. scan from the smallest set, if any of the average value is less than $50, then stop the scan

(ii)Constrain 2: profit>$10 is data Succinct.

 A data succinct constraint means  that data space can be pruned at the initial pattern mining process. Found the profit over $10 is very fast and easy.

Mine measure: if(profit>10)	then(keep)	else(delete)

Constrain 3: sum(price)>100 is pattern monotonic and data anti-monotonic constraint.

Reason: Pattern monotone: if and itemset S satisfies the constraint c, so does any of its superset. Data anti-monotone constraint means that  in the mining process, if a data entry t cannot contribute to a pattern p satisfying c, t cannot contribute  to p’s superset either.

Mine measures: scan and add the profit whose price is greater than 10 , if the sum is less than 100, then stop.

The algorithm in slides is much faster.  When deriving deriving $C_k$ from $F_{k-1}$. Algorithm in slides  **first sort items according to their (k-2) prefix**, then  do the prefix match. While the code only do the prefix match according to the length of item.

code:  compare abc and ade--abcde(not match) 

compare abc and acd----abcd(match)

slides: compare abc and acd---abcd(not match)

compare abc and abd----abcd(match)

        c=join(i,j)
